Gradient Tracer is a Python library designed to leverage automatic differentiation capabilities of established libraries (e.g. PyTorch) to compute gradients for tensor expressions, execute expressions and backpropagation, and store the results serving as reference data for testing other implementation.
This library aims to simplify the process of tracing and logging gradients, making it easier to analyze and debug custom implemenation of machine learning models.

== Features

*  *Automatic Differentiation* : Utilizes PyTorch's autograd to compute gradients for tensor expressions.
*  *Sample Processing*: Processes samples written in Python following logical file and directories structure and naming, executes expressions, and performs backpropagation.
*  *Result Logging*: Stores the computed gradients, operations directed graphs and results into following test structure files for easy analysis and debugging.

== Usage

NOTE: This library is still under heavy development.

* create your working folder
* add subfolders with test suites and test cases following  file names convention (see more about Executable annotation in docs)
* create your virtual environment e.g. with `pipenv --python 3.12`
* install `gradienttracer` from source code `pipenv install git+https://github.com/michalharakal/gradienttracer@main#egg=gradienttracer`
* activate shell `pipenv shell`
* run cli command `gt --help` to commandline parameters
