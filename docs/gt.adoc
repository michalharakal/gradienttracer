= Gradient Tracer File Scanning Mechanism

The Gradient Tracer library is designed to dynamically discover and execute functions annotated with a custom `Executable` annotation. This document describes the folder and file naming conventions, the structure of the library, and the mechanism used for scanning and executing these functions.

== Folder and File Naming Conventions

The library expects a specific folder and file naming convention to locate the scripts and functions to be executed.

=== Folder Naming Convention

The top-level folders should follow the naming convention:

`TS-<NUMBER>`

Where `<NUMBER>` is a numeric identifier. For example:

* `TS-001`
* `TS-002`
* `TS-003`

=== File Naming Convention

Within each `TS-<NUMBER>` folder, the Python script files should follow the naming convention:

`UC-<NUMBER>.py`

Where `<NUMBER>` is a numeric identifier. For example:

* `UC-001.py`
* `UC-002.py`
* `UC-003.py`

== File Structure

The expected structure of the project is as follows:

....
your_data/
├── core.py
├── TS-001/
│   └── UC-001.py
│   └── UC-002.py
├── TS-002/
│   └── UC-001.py
│   └── UC-002.py
└── TS-003/
    └── UC-001.py
    └── UC-002.py
....
