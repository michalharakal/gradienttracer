  "prompt": "Create a logo for 'Gradient Tracer': The logo features a stylized beam of light or laser, starting from the middle left and progressing to the middle right. The beam is composed of multiple thin, horizontal paths mimicking layers of neurons in a deep neural network, creating a gradient effect from maroon to yellow to reddish colors. The background is dark to highlight the light beam. Subtle geometric shapes or lines in the background represent data and tensor operations. Ensure there are more lines to represent the complexity of neural networks.",
